# The developers website

This application was my first Angular+Typescript project. It is a website with 4 devs, each one have its own comments page. You can check the comments or leave a comment if you are logged in. 

I used an API made by myself that can be found <a href="https://github.com/carolf32/the-developers-website-fake-api">here<a/>. 

## Features
- [x] signup, login and logout (or enter as a guest)
- [x] add or delete a comment in a dev page
